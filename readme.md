This project is a bit ambitious so I may set lower goals to get past the assessment but the ultimate goal is to have the following features.

1. The ability to log a typical journal with trades attached.
- The journal will be a typical entry, in which the trader will log his thoughts and actions.
- The trades attached will use Javascript to get addended on to the journal attached to the users thoughts.
- The trades will be checked against some sort of API for accuracy and a log will be kept of the traders accuraccy

2. The ability to make the journals into newsletters.
- The trader can decide to turn his journal posting into a newsletter if he wishes
- the newsletter will have all the same features as journal entry, except that it will be public.
- it should have a feature to email out trade calls, which should be tracked as well.

3. Final ambition is full out trading demo site in which there is a complete front end for traders to trade on, for now it looks like I will use jquery on that.

Steps for preparation.
1. Looks up a market API that will work for my needs.
2. Decide what Javascript should be used for.

Everything else will be picked up after the weekend.
